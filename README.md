# Song Selection

For this project, I have used the song "Long Train Runnin'" by The Doobie Brothers. The song was released in 1973 as part of the album "The Captain and Me". The song is a classic rock song that features a catchy guitar riff and a groovy bassline. The original recording runs 03:27, is in the key of G minor and has a tempo of 117 BPM. More details can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Train_Runnin%27).

# Mixing Process

My mix I have completed using Logic Pro. The basic steps were:

-   Download and import the original stems to Logic Pro.

-   Organise the session (rename, regroup and recolour stems by instrumentation, create markers for sections of the song)

-   Gain stage all of the tracks to appoximately -18dB

-   Clean the tracks - remove any unwanted noise, clicks, pops, bleed, etc. For example, I used a gate on the Lead Vocals to get them sounding crisper.

-   Aligned the phase of the tracks (not much of a problem here)

-   Set the levels of the tracks to create a balanced mix

-   Group instrumentation and apply EQ, compression, reverb, delay, etc. to each group. I tried to use stock Logic Pro plug-ins for this task so that they would appear anywhere

-   Apply automation to the tracks to create movement and dynamics

-   Pan instrumentation left and right for "stereo" tracks (i.e. Electric Guitar, Acoustic Guitar, BVs)

## Mastering Process

Technically, I haven't mastered this track, although I did add the Mastering plug-in to the Stereo Out. I also added an automation to the Stereo Out so that I could fade the outro of the song.

## Reflections

You will see in my Logic session that I have a reference track of the original recording. My objective is / was to remix the given stems to reproduce the original recording. I'm quite happy with my mx - it definitely does sound brighter / crisper than the original though, whcih I suppose is a more modern sound. I haven't added in any mandolin / bluegrass implementation and it would be great to hear this song reworked as a bluegrass song. It has a good tempo, great harmonies and would work well in that genre.

## Version Control

I created a public repository in GitHub for this assignment and every time I update I push my changes to that repo. This gives me the opportunity to go back to earlier commits and / or fork the project when I want to try different things.
